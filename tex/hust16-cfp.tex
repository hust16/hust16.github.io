\section{Introduction}

Supercomputing centers exist to drive scientific discovery by
supporting researchers in computational science fields.  To make users
more productive in the complex HPC environment, HPC centers employ
user support teams.  These teams serve many roles, from setting up
accounts, to consulting on math libraries and code optimization, to
managing HPC software stacks.  Adequately supporting scientists can
often be a struggle for the support teams.  HPC environments are
extremely complex, and combined with the complexity of multi-user
installations, exotic hardware, and maintaining research software,
supporting HPC users can be extremely demanding.  Meeting all of these
competing demands of the scientist often results in the creation of
new tools and establishment of new policies and best practices.

With the third HUST workshop, we will continue to provide a necessary
forum for system administrators, user support team members, tool
developers, policy makers and end users to discuss support issues. We provide a 
necessary publication venue to solicit papers on user support experiences, best practices, tools, and
innovative efforts to improve user support at supercomputing centers.

\section{Topics}

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item defining and customising the user environment
\item software build and installation tools
\item workflow and pipeline tools
\item collaboration tools
\item supporting Hadoop and Spark clusters for \emph{Big Data}
\item establishing baseline configuration efforts for HPC
\item software tools for system testing and monitor
\end{itemize}

\section{Submission}

We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with
sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC
community. Papers should be submitted in PDF format and should not
exceed 10 pages including tables, figures and appendices, but
excluding references. They should be formatted according to the
standard SC15 format, i.e., the double-column IEEE format for
Conference Proceedings (IEEEtran LaTeX Class (template) V1.8 packages
and IEEEtran V1.12 BibTeX (bibliography)). Similar to the SC15 policy,
margins and font sizes should not be modified. We kindly refer authors
to the necessary templates [2].

All submissions should be made electronically through the Easychair
website [3].  Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should
remove their names, institutions or hints found in references to
earlier work. When discussing past work, they need to refer to
themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing another
researcher's work. Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of
interest with the PC chair or PC members.

Proceedings will be published in both IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital
library through collaboration with ACM SIGHPC.

\section{Important dates}
\begin{itemize}
\item Submission deadline: August 12th 2016
\item Workshop paper reviews: by September 19th 2016
