We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with
sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC
community. Papers should be submitted in PDF format and should not
exceed 10 pages including tables, figures and appendices, but
excluding references. They should be formatted according to the
[the IEEE format] for conference proceedings.(http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). _This is a late change
for papers well accept papers in the ACM format for review but will 
be required to be reformatted._ Similar to the SC16 policy, margins 
and font sizes should not be modified. We kindly refer authors to 
the necessary templates.

All submissions should be made electronically through the Easychair website.
Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should remove their names,
institutions or hints found in references to earlier work. When discussing past work,
they need to refer to themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing
another researcher's work. Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of
interest with the PC chair or PC members.

Proceedings will be published in both IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital library
through collaboration with ACM SIGHPC.
